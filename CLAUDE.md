# CLAUDE.md

## Auto-commit (triggered by user command)

When the user types **`claude commit`**, execute the following:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to check for uncommitted changes.
2. If there are any staged or unstaged changes (modified, added, or deleted files):
   a. Stage all changed files with `git add` (specific files, not `-A`).
   b. Generate a concise commit message in **Traditional Chinese** that summarizes what changed, following the existing commit style (short descriptive phrase).
   c. Create the commit.
   d. Push to the remote tracking branch with `git push`.
   e. Report the result to the user.
3. If there are no changes, report "沒有未提交的變更。"

**Do NOT auto-commit on session start.** Only commit when the user explicitly says `claude commit`.

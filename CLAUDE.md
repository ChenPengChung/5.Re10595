# CLAUDE.md

## Auto-commit (triggered by user command)

When the user types **`claude commit`**, execute the following:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to check for uncommitted changes.
2. If there are any staged or unstaged changes (modified, added, or deleted files):
   a. Stage all changed files with `git add` (specific files, not `-A`).
   b. Generate a concise commit message in **Traditional Chinese** that summarizes what changed, following the existing commit style (short descriptive phrase).
   c. Create the commit.
   d. Push to the remote tracking branch with `git push`.
   e. Report the result to the user.
3. If there are no changes, report "沒有未提交的變更。"

**Do NOT auto-commit on session start.** Only commit when the user explicitly says `claude commit`.

## Project info

- Branch: Edit11_GILBM_GTSFrolichWENO7
- Remote: origin (GitHub)
- Language: commit messages should be in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)
- This is a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) LBM simulation project running on HPC clusters (H200/GB200).

## SLURM Job Safety (MANDATORY)

This user runs multiple simulation projects on the same HPC cluster.
**Every project has its own jobs. Never touch another project's jobs.**

### Absolute prohibitions

1. **NEVER run bare `scancel <jobid>`** — always use `./run job-guard scancel <jobid>` which verifies the job belongs to this project before cancelling.
2. **NEVER run `scontrol update/hold/release/requeue/suspend/resume`** on any job.
3. **NEVER infer a jobid from `squeue` output and cancel it** — a job visible in `squeue` may belong to a different project.
4. **NEVER run `scancel -u $USER`** or any batch-cancel command — this would kill ALL of the user's jobs across all projects.

### Allowed SLURM operations

- `squeue` / `sinfo` / `sacct` — read-only queries, always safe
- `scontrol show` / `scontrol listpids` — read-only, safe
- `./run job-guard scancel <jobid>` — project-verified cancel, safe
- `./run job-guard stop-chain` — creates STOP_CHAIN sentinel for this project only
- `sbatch` via `./run` or `./run build` — project submission workflow

### Enforcement

A PreToolUse hook (`chain_code/tools/claude_slurm_guard.sh`) automatically blocks bare `scancel` and modifying `scontrol` commands. If the hook blocks you, do NOT attempt to bypass it.
